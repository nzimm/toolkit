### SQL injection
Discovered around 1998, SQL injection is less common than it was in the late
2000's. The vulnerability manifests when a SQL query is not handled safely,
and a user's input is concatonated directly with the query string. An attacker
can inject arbitrary SQL instructions to a database. [Bobby Tables](https://www.xkcd.com/327/)
is the go-to example for this exploit.

## Quickstart
The demos can be run individually, but the main launcher *toolkit.py* contains
