Program to demonstrate eavsdropping and encryption

[*] Summary
    
    Simple tcp client-server architecture. Out of simplicity, the communication
    is one way: the client sends user-input to the server, which displays
    messages to the screen.

    By default, the connection is unencrypted. By specifying the -e flag when
    executing the client script, the client and server work out the encryption
    in the handshake, and thereafter all transfered data is encrypted.


[*] Usage
    
    1) Load up 3 different terminal windows
    2) Run server.py in the first terminal
    3) Run client.py in the second terminal (optionally with -e flag for encryption)
    3) Run eavesdrop.py in the third terminal
    5) Follow eavesdrop.py prompts to begin sniffing traffic
    6) Enter messages into client.py, and send them to the connected host (server.py)
    7) Watch the eavesdrop.py window decode the traffic and print out the sniffed packet data
